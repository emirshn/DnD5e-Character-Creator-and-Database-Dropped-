# Dnd 5th Edition Character Creator and Database (Dropped)
A character creation tool and database for Dnd 5th edition. It uses [SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) from Wizard of the Coast. I was plannig to finish this project and use as a template for a bigger database but unfortunately scope was too huge for me and i dont have enough time for that.


I started this project for learning Vuetify for Vue.js so i used it. Vuex is also used. For database i used firebase.
## Project setup and install
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
Also users needs to change firebase.js and character actions.js files with their firebase or another database links.
