# Dnd 5th Edition Character Creator and Database (Dropped)
A character creation tool and database for Dnd 5th edition. It uses [SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) from Wizard of the Coast. I was plannig to finish this project and use it with bigger database but unfortunately i dont have enough time for that.


## Project setup and install
```
npm install
npm run serve

```
